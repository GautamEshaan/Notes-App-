🚀 Project Overview

This is a modern and minimal Notes Taking App built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React Icons.
It lets users create, view, and delete notes in a clean, responsive UI — all handled through React state in real time.

Each note card displays:

🏷️ Note title

📝 Note details

❌ Delete button

🛠️ Tech Stack










💻 Responsive Design

The layout works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile, thanks to Tailwind’s grid and flex utilities.

🎯 Key Features

✅ Add and manage notes easily
✅ Delete notes with a single click
✅ Smooth hover & focus animations
✅ Clean dark UI with subtle gradients
✅ Reusable React components with useState hooks
