🚀 Project Overview

This is a modern and minimal Notes Taking App built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React Icons.
It allows users to create, view, and delete notes in a clean and responsive interface — all in real time using React state.

Each note card displays:

🏷️ Note title

📝 Note details

❌ Delete button

🛠️ Tech Stack










💻 Responsive Design

The layout adapts beautifully across desktop, tablet, and mobile — using Tailwind’s grid and flex utilities.

🎯 Key Features

✅ Add and manage notes easily
✅ Delete notes with a single click
✅ Smooth hover and focus animations
✅ Clean dark UI with subtle gradients
✅ Reusable React components with useState hooks

📚 What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:

Managing state using React useState hook

Passing data between components

Building responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS

Using Lucide React icons for modern UI styling

Writing clean, modular, and readable React code

This project helped me understand how to handle user input and update the UI dynamically in React.
